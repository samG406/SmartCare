##  3Ô∏è Sample SQL Queries
Below are some sample queries demonstrating key functionalities of the SmartHealthcare database.

###  ‚Üí Retrieve all appointments for a specific patient
```sql
SELECT a.appointment_id, a.appointment_date, a.status, u.full_name AS doctor_name
FROM Appointments a
JOIN Doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
JOIN Users u ON d.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE a.patient_id = 1;
```
###  ‚Üí List all doctors with their specializations and experience:

``` sql
SELECT u.full_name, d.specialization, d.experience 
FROM Doctors d 
JOIN Users u ON d.user_id = u.user_id 
ORDER BY d.experience DESC; 
```
